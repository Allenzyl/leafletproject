```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%   addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=38.9869, lng=-76.9426, 
             popup="University of Maryland")
my_map
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
